# McdonaldsChatbot
This is a small chatbot i experimented with. The chatbot uses pyhton and a tensorflow neural network.

The intention is to use it as a way to order food at mcdonalds.
 tho food you can order is:
 Big mac, hamburger and a royal crispy bacon.
 The drinks are Cola, Sprite and Fanta.
 The burgers can be put in menu
 
 If you want to try it out, just run the chatbot.py
 There are also 2 jupyter notbooks to setup the model
